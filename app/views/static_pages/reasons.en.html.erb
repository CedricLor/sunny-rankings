I am an employee. Why would I vote?
because I am concerned about women's situation on the workplace
because my employer is doing a great job on this matter and I want the world to know it
because it gives me a voice on a serious matter
because I am committed to democracy
because it's free
because I can share critical information with other people and help make the world a better place
because it is anonymous
because I can myself get information from the ranking system and I want to help others get such information

I am an employer. Why would I accept to be ranked here?
because I am committed to gender equality and I want the worrld to know it
because I have been working a lot to make it happen and I want to make it known
because I care about what my employees feel
because I know the benefits for my firm of having happy employees
because I know the benefits for my firm of employing women
because I do not fear it
because I want to attract the best profiles
because I know my reputation would benefit from it
