I am an employee. Why would I vote?
because it's free
because I am committed to democracy
because it gives me a voice on a serious matter
because it gives me a way to act on a serious matter
because I can share critical information with other people and help make the world a better place
because it is anonymous
because I can myself get information from the ranking system and I want to help others get such information

I am an employer. Why would I accept to be ranked here?
because you are committed to gender equality
because you have been working a lot to make it happen and you want to make it known
because you care about what your employees feel
because you do not fear it
because you want to attract the best profile
because you know your reputation would benefit from it
