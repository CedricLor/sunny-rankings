Hi! Was it you?


Someone using this email address (<%= @usermail %>) has posted a request for the creation of a file for <%= @requested_firm.name %> on <%= link_to("skanher", "http://www.skanher.se") %>.

However, such person was not logged in on your account.

Because we do not want anyone to use your email address fraudulently, we always send an email to our members when their email address is used on our <%= link_to("website", "http://www.skanher.se") %>.

If it was you, you do not have anything to do.

If it was not you, please take the time to let us know so that we can improve our security measures at: <%= mail_to("security@skanher.se", "security@skanher.se") %>.

If it was you, thank you for having taken the time to notify us of this missing firm and contributing to making the world a better, more equal place.

Else, please accept our apologies for the disturbance.

We hope to see you soon again on <%= link_to("skanher", "http://www.skanher.se") %>.
